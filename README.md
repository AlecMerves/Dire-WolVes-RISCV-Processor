# Dire-WolVes RISC-V Processor

This projected started as a senior capstone project I had the honor of leading during my final year at Stony Brook University. This project was the collaborated effort between myself, [Jiajun Lin](https://github.com/jlin-edu), [Baron Mai](https://github.com/bmai5305) under the guidance of Professor Peter Milder. The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/jlin-edu/ESE440-RISCV), as this is my personal copy to continue working on alone. I have plans to continue expanding and editing this project in my personal time to improve my skills and knowledge of processor architectures.
