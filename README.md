# Dire-WolVes RISC-V Processor

This projected started as a senior capstone project I had the honor of leading during my final year at Stony Brook University. This project was the collaborated effort between myself, Jiajun Lin, Baron Mai under the guidance of Professor Peter Milder. The original repository can be found here, as this is my personal copy to continue working on alone. I have plans to continue expanding and editing this project in my personal time to improve my skills and knowledge of processor architectures.
